# Revolutionizing knowledge creation

**Guaana Challenge** - Open Collaboration format built for scientists.

>**Open Collaboration Challenge** (OCC): self-organizing community of individuals coordinated towards a shared outcome, which they make publicly available to contributors and non-contributors alike

Whether it’s your **reserach** or an **important cause**, these topics can be too complex to tackle on your own. Guaana Challenge **connects bright minds** around your call, forming a collective where ideas can be rapidly improved by many.

**OPEN IS BETTER**

**Sharing**
Instead of getting stolen, publicly shared ideas transform the author into the source.

**Diversity**
Acquire new thoughts from ideas shared and comments received. Best ideas are often the result of disagreements and contest.

**Cross-disciplinary**
Novel ideas often come from unexpected sources and outside of your field

# Your actions make a difference

Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, Open Collaboration Challenges rely on the number of people contributing to a common effort. **Share knowledge, offer expert advice and collectively seek solutions.**
