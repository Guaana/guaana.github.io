## Guaana Challenge

**Open Collaboration format built for scientists.**

>Open Collaboration: self-organizing community of individuals coordinated towards a shared outcome, which they make publicly available to contributors and noncontributors alike

Whether it’s your **reserach** or an **important cause**, these topics can be too complex to tackle on your own. Use our Challenge platform to **find collaborators** from around the world.


## Your actions make a difference

Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, Open Collaboration Challenges rely on the number of people contributing to a common effort. **Share knowledge, offer expert advice and collectively seek solutions.**
