# Guaana

Founded in 2014, from Estonia; [the worlds most digital country](https://e-estonia.com), Guaana is a community-based platform to run online innovation & research challenges.

We are a team driven by design thinking, constantly looking for ways to simplify complex processes. As designers and developers, we come from a background of open and web-based collaboration practices. Our purpose is to bring the same benefits to the world of research and innovation.


## What we do

Guaana builds creative solutions for research funding and innovation. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we adapt approaches from non-research focused applications used to solve challenges similar to those faced in research funding, and implement them into the evaluation of scientific work in ways that enhance collaboration and transparency in the process.

Guaana works with governments and organizations from all over the world, helping them to:

* Distribute research grants - 6x times faster, and 75% more efficient
* Run online hackathons - remove manual activities, and engage globally 
* Gather ideas through an online workshop - remove travel time & expense, infinite scale, a more flexible use of time, global reach, low admin requirement 

Everything in one app, no more juggling files and data between multiple different systems.

## Journey

For the past five years, we have been working closely with researchers & innovators from around the world. We have interviewed, listened and challenged many, in order to map and understand the root causes of key challenges faced by researchers and innovators in their work.
First iteration of Guaana was launched in April 2015 - a platform that has brought together a community of over 4000 members from around the world to spark creative conversations around preliminary research ideas, ideations, social change and much more. 

Our vision is to be the biggest innovation & research community in the world.
