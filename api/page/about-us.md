The word Guaana is a derivative of *gnana* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana), a Sanskrit term for knowledge. Just with some extra ring to it. And yes, we are content with itâ€™s resemblance to guano (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano), which just happens to be one of the best natural fertilizers in the world.

**We are building Guaana to accelerate scientific collaboration. A hub to scale up creative conversation, to connect and build meaningful partnerships. A place that speeds up the problem-solving process, and expands the range of problems that can be solved by the human mind.**

We are a community of scientists, innovators, engineers, thinkers, and visionaries brought together by a passion to accelerate scientific and technological breakthroughs.

## Guaana Project

Guaana Project is a tool used by scientists to grow a network around their preliminary research or technology. This network becomes a hub where ideas are discussed openly and rapidly improved by many minds. Based on this exchange of ideas and willingness to collaborate, new professional connections are naturally formed. And these new connections are not formed just between the scientists themselves, but also with companies.

**Share knowledge, discuss bold ideas, and find collaborators to explore ways of turning concepts into reality.**
