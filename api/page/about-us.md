### A Time of Change

Scientific community is currently isolated from one another and scattered globally. There is no one place to search for specialists outside your discipline who are open to collaboration. This creates a bottleneck and hinders the process as most challenges faced today need a more interdisciplinary approach.

Complex global problems, such as energy, environmental issues, pandemics or diseases related to aging societies, etc. have to be faced jointly. Both international and interdisciplinary collaborative work is needed to achieve high-quality investigations and grand scale solutions.

World needs scientific visionaries who exemplify that there are no borders in science, neither between countries nor between cultures or disciplines. And forward thinking companies who demonstrate that the best way to innovate is to open up to the entire global community.

World needs a source of inspiration for the upcoming generation of potential scientists who have grown up in a digitized world where all information is readily available at any given time. A medium that opens up science to anyone with interest.
