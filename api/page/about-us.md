# Revolutionizing knowledge creation

**Guaana Challenge** - Open Collaboration format built for scientists.

>**Open Collaboration Challenge** (OCC): self-organizing community of individuals coordinated towards a shared outcome, which they make publicly available to contributors and non-contributors alike

Whether it’s your **research** or an **important cause**, these topics can be too complex to tackle on your own. Broadcasting your endeavor openly through Guaana Challenge **attracts inspired minds** around your call, forming a collective where ideas can rapidly be improved through an intellectual conversation.

Open Collaboration is the best source of divergent thinking, inter-disciplinary connections, stimulating debate. And this is where **truly innovative** and **creative ideas** come from.


**Your actions make a difference**</br>
Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, Open Collaboration Challenges rely on the number of people contributing to a common effort. **Share knowledge, offer expert advice and collectively seek solutions.** Actively amplifying our collective intelligence makes us smarter and so better able to solve the toughest scientific problems.

# Connecting companies to cool ideas and the people behind it.

When a company is watching a Challenge then it is because the topic under investigation is relevant to their field and they are on a look out for top talent. **Be active, have fun and quite possibly land your dream job.**
