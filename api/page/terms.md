Guaana.com is a platform for sharing ideas, knowledge and information. We only provide an online venue for our users and do not source or deliver Projects or solutions ourselves. We do not claim any rights in or to the ideas you share.

We encourage you to share your ideas! However, since guaana.com is a public platform, we feel it is important for you to understand that under Estonian laws, copyright protects only the objective form of works – original results in the literary, artistic or scientific domain – but not ideas, images, notions, theories, processes, systems, methods, concepts, principles, discoveries, inventions, and other results of intellectual activities which are described, explained or expressed in any other manner in a work.

Such ideas may be valuable, however, as they may lead to inventions. For example, inventions in any field of technology may be protected by a patent or a utility model if the invention fulfils the respective criteria. You should also make sure not to share any confidential information.

In case you have any questions regarding sharing your ideas on Guaana.com, please consult the website of the Estonian Patent Office (www.epa.ee), the World Intellectual Property Organisation (www.wipo.int) or other guidance materials such as IPR Helpdesk (www.iprhelpdesk.eu). It goes without saying that you should always seek advice of a patent attorney or a lawyer when managing your intellectual property rights. However, feel free to contact us, as well!

You expressly understand and agree that:

Except as expressly warranted in the Terms, all Services are provided "as is" and Guaana hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with regard to the Services, whether express, implied or statutory, including all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.

In no event shall Guaana or its respective suppliers aggregate liability for direct damages under this Agreement exceed the fees paid by you for the immediately preceding month before the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Guaana, its officers, directors, employees, and agents for any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of your connection to or use of the Services, including but not limited to any breach by you of these Terms and any claims arising from the Content you submit, post, transmit or make available through the Services.
