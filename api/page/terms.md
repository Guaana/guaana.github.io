Guaana.com is a platform for funding open research projects, sharing ideas, knowledge and information. We only provide an online venue for our users and do not source or deliver Projects or solutions ourselves. We do not claim any rights in or to the ideas you share.

We encourage you to share your ideas! However, since guaana.com is a public platform, we feel it is important for you to understand that under Estonian laws, i.e. under which we operate, copyright protects only the objective form of works – original results in the literary, artistic or scientific domain – but not ideas, images, notions, theories, processes, systems, methods, concepts, principles, discoveries, inventions, and other results of intellectual activities which are described, explained or expressed in any other manner in a work.

Such ideas may be valuable, however, as they may lead to inventions. For example, inventions in any field of technology may be protected by a patent or a utility model if the invention fulfils the respective criteria. You should also make sure not to share any confidential information.

In case you have any questions regarding sharing your ideas on Guaana.com, please consult the website of the Estonian Patent Office (www.epa.ee), the World Intellectual Property Organisation (www.wipo.int) or other guidance materials such as IPR Helpdesk (www.iprhelpdesk.eu). It goes without saying that feel free to contact us, as well!

By accessing or using our Services, you hereby agree to be bound by this Agreement (as defined below) and all terms and their modifications are incorporated herein by this reference.
