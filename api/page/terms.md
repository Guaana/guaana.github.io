As part of your enjoyment of the Services, subject to these Terms, you may grant a third party access to your account to provide additional products, services or labor provided you agree to be responsible for the actions of the third party and to bind the third party to these Terms as your agent.

From time to time, separate applications or services that integrate or interoperate with the Guaana Services (collectively, "Add-ons") may become available, either directly from Guaana or independently.

Accordingly, such applications are governed by their own terms and conditions and are not considered Services under these Terms.

## Warranty Disclaimers

You expressly understand and agree that:

Except as expressly warranted in the terms, all Services are provided "as is" and Guaana hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with regard to the Services, whether express, implied or statutory, including all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.

In no event shall Guaana or its respective suppliers aggregate liability for direct damages under this agreement exceed the fees paid for the immediately preceding month before the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
