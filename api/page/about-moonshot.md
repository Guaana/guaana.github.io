### Open to everyone

Everything shared and discussed in Guaana Moonshots is public and should be regarded as a collection of ideas and a source of inspiration.

### Free for all

We believe that monetizing collaboration hinders the process of innovation and therefore we promise to keep our Moonshot format free, now and forever.

### Non-commercial

Guaana Moonshot is not intended for businesses seeking solutions. For technology transfer with commercial interests we are developing Guaana Project, a format where companies attribute money rewards to R&D assignments.
