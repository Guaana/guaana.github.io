### Q: “What is Guaana?”

Guaana is a **platform** that connects the global scientific community to each other and offers the necessary tools for **interdisciplinary collaboration.**

For example, if you are a robotics expert working on a new drone and are in need of help in the field of biology and data science (to figure out the flight algorithm of a hummingbird) then you can Moonshot your idea/research and attract experts from a round the world to collaborate with you.

### Q: “What is a Moonshot?”

Guaana Moonshot is a public exploration and discussion format we developed for anyone with bold ideas or breakthrough research. See, the example above doesn’t cover it all - Moonshots are meant for **any kind of open collaboration.**

That means anyone — scientists, researchers, engineers, visionaries, social entrepreneurs, government officials to name a few — can post a need or an idea for public discussion and collaborative research.

A project or proposal that:

* Addresses a huge problem
* Proposes a radical solution
* Uses breakthrough technology

### Q: “Can you give some examples of Moonshots?”

Sure! Here are some Moonshots we are launching our public beta with.

Awarded Alzheimer's and cancer researcher Eva Vertes George is [investigating](https://guaana.com/moonshots/ts83rnuqDoepevPGH/vision) factors in skeletal muscle which have anti-tumour/anti-metastatic activity in her Moonshot.

Priit Rifk from Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is [investigating](https://guaana.com/moonshots/dpG2NANRiYm4knRS8/vision) ways to detect drones that fly in restricted areas.

World renowned psychiatrist and author Ben Ambridge is [investigating](https://guaana.com/moonshots/cA6rBHqWNCMGBbFFs/vision) how children’s language develops from cries and squeals into a complex system.

You can see all our Moonshots [here](https://guaana.com/moonshots)

### Q: “Why should I post a Moonshot?”

It's a great way to **share your vision** with the world and **attract participation.** Moonshot acts as beacon by gathering a community around your idea who are invested in finding a solution.

### Q: “What? It’s about the Moon?”

No. No moon. Zero moon involved. Unless you Moonshot about it. Then we are all about the moon.

Moonshot is a term that derives from the Apollo 11 spaceflight project, which landed the first human on the moon in 1969. Moonshot may also reference the phrase "shoot for the moon", meaning aim for a lofty target.

Moonshot in a technology context is an ambitious, exploratory and ground-breaking project undertaken without any expectation of near-term profitability and perhaps, without a full investigation of potential risks or benefits.

In layman terms, Moonshot means **“Screw it, lets do it.”**

### Q: “How do you guys make money? It’s all for free!”

Moonshots are free and always will be. To keep sustainable we are developing **Guaana Projects** - a format where companies can post their R&D needs with money rewards. We call this **crowdsourcing innovation.**

### Q: “Wait… only social logins?”

You really want to type in all your information again? If you do, please get in touch and we will set up and account for you.

### Q: "Are you going to post without my permission on my Twitter / Facebook / LinkedIn / Google page?”

No, never. Social log in is just for the sake of convenience.

### Q: “Ok, I have this awesome idea/research - definitely worth a Moonshot. Is anyone going to steal it?”

Moonshots are related to known global topics and therefore don’t need intellectual property protection.

We believe that **instead** of getting your ideas stolen you can **find people** from around the world to **team up with.** People are awesome like that. That’s how Guaana came to life.

If you see a need for it, just let us know and we'll develop an option for a closed Moonshot.

### Q: “Why are you doing this?”

Because science **can be** accessible and open.

### Q: “Are you aware that ________ is the biggest issue in academic world right now?”

We have many plans in the pipeline and together we can figure out how to solve them. We are closely listening to our community and if you want to join our scientific advisory board then please [e-mail us](mailto:info@guaana.com).

### Q: “Can I contact you with more questions?”

Sure, Just [e-mail us](mailto:info@guaana.com).
